# Code Editor Shortcuts

This [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) plugin adds keyboard shortcuts (hotkeys) commonly found in code editors such as Visual Studio Code or Sublime Text.

This fork adds 4 extra shortcuts inspired by Typora's workspace. Use `Ctrl + 1/2/3/4` to quickly switch between headings.
